# AddUn

### My first Swift app

### **Heavily** inspired by https://learnappmaking.com/creating-a-simple-ios-game-with-swift-in-xcode/

## Production
* All produced in XCode 12.5.1, using an iPhone 12 simulator, on a 2015 Macbook Pro (8gb, pls send help)

## How to play:
* A number appears on the screen, currently set to 3 digits long.
* The player has to type in a number, equivalent to adding 1 to each digit individually.
* For example, the answer to'817' is'928'.
* For values of 9, the answer is zero. For example '919' becomes '020'.
* The player has 1 minute to get as many correct as they can, with 5 points added to their score for each correct answer.
* After time is up, a message pops up with the final score, and the option to play again

## Items needing addressed
* Background images and formatting. Seen better looking command prompts
* Constraints for different sized screens
* Typing non-numeric characters is still allowed

## Desired Functionality
* Player can choose how many digits they want (1 to a max e.g. 6 before having to worry about resizing issues and changing font size)
* Player can set the time, or we have speed round or normal options
* High score saved during play
* High score saved after quit, and reloaded
* Make a UI based keyboard in the game, instead of having to rely on the player's device
* Sound effects for Correct/Wrong, and game finished
* Sound effects for time left being under 10 or 5 seconds
* Option to toggle sound effects
* Some animations and prettyness
